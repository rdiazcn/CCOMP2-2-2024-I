3.  (Gas Mileage) Drivers are concerned with the mileage
    obtained by their automobiles. One driver has kept track of
    several trips by recording miles driven and gallons used for
    each trip. Develop a C++ program that uses a while statement
    to input the miles driven and gallons used for each trip. The
    program should calculate and display the miles per gallon
    obtained for each trip and print the combined miles per gallon
    obtained for all tankfuls up to this point.
        Enter miles driven (-1 to quit): 287
        Enter gallons used: 13
        MPG this trip: 22.076923
        Total MPG: 22.076923
        Enter miles driven (-1 to quit): 200
        Enter gallons used: 10
        MPG this trip: 20.000000
        Total MPG: 21.173913
        Enter the miles driven (-1 to quit): 120
        Enter gallons used: 5
        MPG this trip: 24.000000
        Total MPG: 21.678571
        Enter the miles used (-1 to quit): -1

4.  (Credit Limits) Develop a C++ program that will
    determine whether a department-store customer has exceeded
    the credit limit on a charge account. For each customer, the
    following facts are available:
        A. Account number (an integer)
        B. Balance at the beginning of the month
        C. Total of all items charged by this customer this month
        D. Total of all credits applied to this customer's account this
        month
        E. Allowed credit limit
    The program should use a while statement to input each of
    these facts, calculate the new balance (= beginning balance +
    charges – credits) and determine whether the new balance
    exceeds the customer’s credit limit. For those customers whose
    credit limit is exceeded, the program should display the
    customer’s account number, credit limit, new balance and the
    message “Credit Limit Exceeded.”
        Enter account number (or -1 to quit): 100
        Enter beginning balance: 5394.78
        Enter total charges: 1000.00
        Enter total credits: 500.00
        Enter credit limit: 5500.00
        New balance is 5894.78
        Account:      100
        Credit limit: 5500.00
        Balance:      
        5894.78
        Credit Limit Exceeded.
        Enter Account Number (or -1 to quit): 200
        Enter beginning balance: 1000.00
        Enter total charges: 123.45
        Enter total credits: 321.00
        Enter credit limit: 1500.00
        New balance is 802.45
        Enter Account Number (or -1 to quit): -1

5.  (Sales-Commission Calculator) A large company pays
    its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople each
    receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that
    week. For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of
    chemicals in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000, or a total
    of $650. Develop a C++ program that uses a while statement
    to input each salesperson’s gross sales for last week and
    calculates and displays that salesperson’s earnings. Process
    one salesperson’s figures at a time.
        Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 5000.00
        Salary is: $650.00
        Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 6000.00
        Salary is: $740.00

6.  (Salary Calculator) Develop a C++ program that uses a
    while statement to determine the gross pay for each of several
    employees. The company pays “straight time” for the first 40
    hours worked by each employee and pays “time-and-a-half” for
    all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. You are given a list of
    the employees of the company, the number of hours each
    employee worked last week and the hourly rate of each
    employee. Your program should input this information for each
    employee and should determine and display the employee’s
    gross pay.
        Enter hours worked (-1 to end): 39
        Enter hourly rate of the employee ($00.00): 10.00
        Salary is $390.00
        Enter hours worked (-1 to end): 40
        Enter hourly rate of the employee ($00.00): 10.00
        Salary is $400.00
        Enter hours worked (-1 to end): 41
        Enter hourly rate of the employee ($00.00): 10.00
        Salary is $415.00
        Enter hours worked (-1 to end): -1

7.  (Find the Largest) The process of finding the largest
    number (i.e., the maximum of a group of numbers) is used
    frequently in computer applications. For example, a program
    that determines the winner of a sales contest inputs the number
    of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells
    the most units wins the contest. Write a C++ program that uses
    a while statement to determine and print the largest of 10
    numbers input by the user. Your program should use three
    variables, as follows:
        A. counter—A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of
        how many numbers have been input and to determine
        when all 10 numbers have been processed).
        B. number—The current number input to the program.
        C. largest—The largest number found so far
    
8.  (Tabular Output) Write a C++ program that uses a while
    statement and the tab escape sequence \t to print the
    following table of values:
        N       10*N    100*N   1000*N
        1       10      100     1000
        2       20      200     2000
        3       30      300     3000
        4       40      400     4000
        5       50      500     5000

9.  (Find the Two Largest Numbers) Using an approach
    similar to that in Exercise 4.17, find the two largest values
    among the 10 numbers. [Note: You must input each number
    only once.]

10. (Validating User Input) The examination-results program
    of Fig. 4.14 assumes that any value input by the user that’s not
    a 1 must be a 2. Modify the application to validate its inputs. On
    any input, if the value entered is other than 1 or 2, keep looping
    until the user enters a correct value.

16. (Square of Asterisks) Write a program that reads in the
    size of the side of a square, then prints a hollow square of that
    size out of asterisks and blanks. Your program should work for
    squares of all side sizes between 1 and 20. For example, if
    your program reads a size of 5, it should print
        *****
        *   *
        *   *
        *   *
        *****

17. (Palindromes) A palindrome is a number or a text phrase
    that reads the same backward as forward. For example, each
    of the following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321,
    55555, 45554 and 11611. Write a program that reads in a five
    digit integer and determines whether it’s a palindrome. [Hint:
    Use the division and remainder operators to separate the
    number into its individual digits.]

18. (Printing the Decimal Equivalent of a Binary Number)
    Input an integer containing only 0s and 1s (i.e., a “binary”
    integer) and print its decimal equivalent. Use the remainder and
    division operators to pick off the “binary” number’s digits one at
    a time from right to left. Much as in the decimal number system,
    where the rightmost digit has a positional value of 1, the next
    digit left has a positional value of 10, then 100, then 1000, and
    so on, in the binary number system the rightmost digit has a
    positional value of 1, the next digit left has a positional value of
    2, then 4, then 8, and so on. Thus the decimal number 234 can
    be interpreted as 2 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 4 * 1. The decimal
    equivalent of binary 1101 is 1 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 8 or 1 + 0
    + 4 + 8, or 13. [Note: To learn more about binary numbers,
    refer to Appendix D.]

19. (Checkerboard Pattern of Asterisks) Write a program
    that displays the following checkerboard pattern. Your program
    must use only three output statements, one of each of the
    following forms:
        cout << "* ";
        cout << ' ';
        cout << endl;
        * * * * * * * *
         * * * * * * * *
        * * * * * * * *
         * * * * * * * *
        * * * * * * * *
         * * * * * * * *
        * * * * * * * *
         * * * * * * * *

20. (Multiples of 2 with an Infinite Loop) Write a program
    that prints the powers of the integer 2, namely 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. 
    Your while loop should not terminate (i.e., you should
    create an infinite loop). To do this, simply use the keyword true
    as the expression for the  while statement. What happens when
    you run this program?

21. (Calculating a Circle’s Diameter, Circumference and
    Area) Write a program that reads the radius of a circle (as a
    double value) and computes and prints the diameter, the
    circumference and the area. Use the value 3.14159 for π.

23. (Sides of a Triangle) Write a program that reads three
    nonzero double values and determines and prints whether they
    could represent the sides of a triangle

24. (Sides of a Right Triangle) Write a program that reads
    three nonzero integers and determines and prints whether
    they’re the sides of a right triangle.

25. (Factorial) The factorial of a nonnegative integer n is
    written n! (pronounced “n factorial”) and is defined as follows:
        n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) ... * 1
        n! = 1 (for n=0 or n=1).
    For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1  , which is 120. Use while
    statements in each of the following:
        A. Write a program that reads a nonnegative integer and
        computes and prints its factorial.
        B. Write a program that estimates the value of the
        mathematical constant e by using the formula:
                     1     1     1    
            e = 1 + --- + --- + --- + ...
                     1!    2!    3!
        Prompt the user for the desired accuracy of e (i.e., the
        number of terms in the summation).
        C. Write a program that computes the value of  by using
        the formula
                     x    x^2   x^3    
            e = 1 + --- + --- + --- + ...
                     1!    2!    3!
        Prompt the user for the desired accuracy of e (i.e., the
        number of terms in the summation).
